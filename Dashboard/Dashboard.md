# Dashboard description

The top map visualization depicts how the states are affected by each contaminant individually. The contaminant (Arsenic, Flouride, Iron, Nitrate, Salinity) can be chosen using the filter on the right (It is a drop down box through which we can choose). When the mouse is hovered over the map, we can see the number of drinking water habitations affected by each of the contaminant.

The bar graph visualization narrows down the maximum number of contaminant water habitations in districts all over the country. When the mouse pointer is hovered over the each bar of the graph, we can see the name of the district, state, number of water habitations that are contaminated by the particular contaminant.
